## Tips To Write Research Papers - Thomas Reps

* Main Goal is to convey your idea from your head to reader's
* Convey your intuition followed by technical details
* Introduce and visualize the problem and idea before moving into details
* Use the space wisely, pay attention to importance of the section 
* Keep the reader interested
* Be clear about the main thing
* You need a narrative flow
* Reread and Self-critique
* Possible Structure:
  - Introduction
  - Overview & Problem Statement
  - [Terminalogy and Notation]
  - Core Algorithm/Idea
  - [Extensions]
  - Experiments
  - [Limitations/Threats to Validity]
  - Related Work
  - [Conclusion]
* Abstract:
  - State the problem
  - Say why its an interesting problem
  - Say what your solution achieves
  - Say what follows from your solution
* Introduction:
  - Describe the problem
  - State your contributions  , ideally  3-5 of them
  - [How rest of the paper is organized]
> For each claim in the intro, identify the evidences and forward reference it from the claim
* Overview & Problem Statement
  - Convey the takeaway
* Problem Statement
  - State the problem independent of any particular solution
* [Terminalogy and Notation]
* Core Algorithm/Idea
* [Extensions]
  - The above 3 sections contribute to the teachnical meat
* Experiments
  - Experimental questions
  - Experimental setup
  - Experimental results
* [Limitations/Threats to Validity]
  - Under what conditions do the conclusions hold
  - Is there a bias?
  - Relevant parameters
* Related Work
  - Honest comparison
  - Be generous to competititon
  - Acknowledge weaknesses in your approach
* Conslusion
  - Reiterate the important things
