## Machine Learning

# Lesson 1 - ML is the ROX
* ML is about building intelligent artifacts that learn overtime based on experience and also, the science, the math and the engineering behind it.
* Supervised Learning is taking labelled datasets and gleaning infomartion so that you can label new datasets.
* Unsupervised Learning is about deriving common patterns from the data available by looking at the relationships. 
* Reinforcement learning is learning from delayed rewards through interaction with the environment.
* Fundamental problem behind ML is generalization, in particular inductive bias.
* Most of ML is about induction i.e. creating a general rule from example (specifics to generalities) or generalization 
  as opposed to deduction i.e. going from general rules to specific instances or reasoning.
